- persistent volumes casdata:/var/lib/cassandra
- using global mode -> only one instance per node

# replicated mode
#- scaling service with initial 3 nodes is working
#- scaling up after scaling down doesn't work -> need to reuse of IP or remove "dead node"
#- restart VM -> Dead Node has to be removed manually (noderemove) in order to let the node join with new IP
